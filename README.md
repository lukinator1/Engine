# The-Super-Suspension-System

With this project, I intend to explore and examine some of the usefulness of formal methods in software development by applying it to a large software project. The software project that will be applied in question will be a 3D game engine. I intend for the design of this engine to be as fundamental/generic as possible, as in holding as many of the fundamental or commonly found pieces/aspects of a game engine as possible. This is so that the potential benefits/uses of formal methods towards game/game engine development in general can be seen. I also hope to discuss how the development of other similar systems that follow a similar architecture to that of a game engine could possibly by affected by the use of fomral methods in the process. 

So far the intended subsystems for this project hope to include:
main game loop
cameras
GUI
scripting
lighting
audio
animation
sprites
physics/collision
rendering
resource manager/database
profiler/debugger
localization tools
input/output handling
RNG handling
math library
AI
game logic

Although the list seems long, I intend only to implement them on a fundamental level, doing the basic/fundamental things that would be seen in most game engines, should they include said components, but nothing advanced beyond that. Much of the development process will take inspiration from Cleanroom Software Engineering, which is a development method that utilizes formal methods in its process.
