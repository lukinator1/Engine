# Engine

/*/ this description is outdated, will be updated soon /*/

With this project, I intend to explore and examine some of the usefulness of formal methods in software development by applying it to a large software project. The software project that will be applied in question will be a 3D game engine. I intend for the design of this engine to be as fundamental/generic as possible, as in holding as many of the fundamental or commonly found pieces/aspects of most 3D game engines as possible. This is so that the potential benefits/uses of formal methods towards game/game engine development in general can be seen/explored. I also hope to discuss how the development of other similar systems that follow a similar architecture to that of a game engine could possibly by affected by the use of fomral methods in the process. 

So far the intended subsystems for this project hope to include:

main game loop

cameras

GUI

scripting

lighting

audio

animation

sprites

physics/collision

rendering

resource manager/database

profiler/debugger

localization tools

input/output handling

RNG handling

math library

AI

game logic

memory manager

Although the list seems long, I intend only to implement them on a fundamental level, doing the basic/fundamental things that would be seen in most game engines, should they include said components, but nothing advanced beyond that. Much of the development process will take inspiration from Cleanroom Software Engineering, which is a software development method that utilizes formal methods in its process. Along with other formal methods for development/design, I will only use parts that make sense in the development of a game engine, or that can be accomplished with a 1 man team. Not every part of the code will neecssarily be implemented through these methods, but any practical part I can try to find that could be.
