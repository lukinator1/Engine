To run it, go to Engine/x64/Debug then double click on Project2.exe, it has the icon with the 2 S's on them. If it gets stuck loading try going to the terminal window that opens up on the side and press any key. Press control and the 1/2/3 keys to switch between the 3 scenes. 

I did not create and do not own any of the unique models used, all were downloaded for free from places such as sketchfab or turbosquid.
